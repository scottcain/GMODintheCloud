If you have data that you'd like to save on this machine, do not save it
in /home/ubuntu, since it will be lost if you terminate this machine or
move to a newer version of GMOD in the Cloud.  Instead, save it in the 
volume that goes with this machine, at /data/dataHome, linked to in
/home/ubuntu/dataHome.
